# Atomic_coordinates_GEOR_NiOOH
Contains the atomic coordinates for structures in the article "Identifying the Role of Bismuth in Glycerol Electro-Oxidation Reactions on beta-NiOOH". Authors: R. Cicciarella and N. Mosey.

The most energetically favourable structures are noted below for the molecules with different structural configurations.

## Bare NiOOH
GLAD ==> C1

GLA acid ==> C2

LAC acid ==> C1

FA ==> C1

GA ==> C1

## Bi NiOOH
GLAD ==> C1

GLA acid ==> C1

LAC acid ==> C2

FA ==> C2

GA ==> C2

### Note: C1 is an abbreviation for "configuration 1" and is primarily used as a placeholder. It may not necessarily represent the addition/removal of the same atoms on both surfaces. In the case of glyceraldehyde specifically, the C1-C4 in the file names do correspond to the same hydrogen atoms removed as shown in Figure 2.
